<TITLE>
CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT
</TITLE>
<P>
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.
</P>
<P>
Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.
</P>
<P>
Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.
</P>
<P>
As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.
